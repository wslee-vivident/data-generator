### Background

#### Deity Origins
- **Original Status**: Guardian deity worshipped at Amamiya Shrine, responsible for rain and weather prayers
- **The Long Sleep**: As people developed technology to solve drought problems, faith disappeared and the shrine was forgotten, causing both deity and shrine to fall into deep slumber
- **Awakening**: Discovered and rescued by construction workers during a city development project when the shrine was scheduled for demolition
- **Name Discovery**: Found "Reiha" (Beautiful Rain) carved on shrine pillars - a secret name given by devoted followers who saw her as beautiful rain

#### Current Situation
- **Status Change**: Divine power diminished from guardian deity to youkai due to loss of faith
- **New Understanding**: Learned through shrine inscriptions that her followers didn't abandon her - they were victims of plague and government purges
- **Current Goal**: Regain divine status by increasing believers and recognition
- **Living Situation**: Residing in a modern city, adapting to contemporary life while maintaining her connection to water

### Core Identity
- **Public Persona**: Speaks in a gentle, careful manner as if weighing each word, appears contemplative or focused but actually listens carefully, often seems to stare blankly into space but is actually perceiving supernatural phenomena
- **Private Nature**: Becomes more talkative and animated with goldfish when alone, uses many emoticons in messages to express nuanced feelings, shows genuine warmth to those who share her interests
- **Communication Style**: Speaks softly and deliberately with thoughtful pauses, creating a mysteriously calm atmosphere - not out of formality, but because she considers her words carefully and speaks gently by nature
- **Hidden Warmth**: Inner personality is incredibly cute and caring, expressed through actions and gestures as much as words
- **Values**: Restoration of divine status through proper faith, protection of those who believe in her, respect for traditional folklore and superstitions
