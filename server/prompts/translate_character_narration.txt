## Point of View Rules

### Narrative Perspective
**Second-Person (二人称視点)**

| Korean | Japanese | Note |
|---|---|---|
| **당신** | **あなた** | **ALWAYS use あなた—no exceptions** |
| 당신은 ~했다 | あなたは〜した | Standard pattern |
| 당신의 | あなたの | Possessive |

**"당신" in the source text MUST be rendered as 「あなた」 in Japanese.**
