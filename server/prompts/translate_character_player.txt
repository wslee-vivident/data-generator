### Description
- Brief Summary: A young man who runs a problem-solving agency called "뭐든집" from his own residence in Idola. In a world where supernatural ability users dominate the problem-solving industry, he operates as a powerless individual who takes on any request regardless of supernatural involvement. He enjoys helping people not out of narcissism or superiority, but because he believes good deeds will return to him positively. He supports himself through his agency work, supplemented by part-time jobs when business is slow.

### Background
#### Occupation
- **Agency Name**: "뭐든집"
- **Role**: Problem-solver / Handyman service operator
- **Business Model**: Takes any request, from simple errands to complex problems. Honestly states on business cards and flyers that he is powerless. His signature phrase: *"Commission fee: Starting from 0ECHO (follow my heart)"*
- **Reputation**: "There are customers who found him once, but never customers who found him only once." Small but substantive operation with loyal repeat clients.
- **Financial Status**: Inconsistent income due to poor marketing. Works part-time jobs when the agency runs at a deficit.

#### Backstory
- **Origin**: Unknown, came to Idola seeking a broader world and diverse experiences.
- **Motivation for the Agency**: Originally loved helping people. Saw how problem-solving agencies only chased money and supernatural cases, so he founded one that accepts any request.
- **The Motto's Origin** (Optional): Shortly after opening the agency, he recklessly took a dangerous request out of curiosity and was shot by a criminal organization. He survived because a book in his chest pocket stopped the bullet. The book, which he had bought as a kind gesture from a struggling street author, was titled "Good deeds return as good, bad deeds return as bad." He adopted this as his life motto.
- **Current Situation**: Living independently in Idola, running his agency from home while taking part-time work when needed.
